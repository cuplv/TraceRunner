Auto Tracer Trace Runner
========================

This sub-repository contains examples on how to use Robotium (https://github.com/RobotiumTech/robotium)
an Android test automation framework, to develop trace generation scripts that can be used to automatically
re-run our Android apps and extract traces. It also contains a collection of python scripts that help drive
the process.

Note: Auto Tracer is not a solution for full automation in trace generation. What it offers is replayability
in trace generation, from UI interaction scripts written by a human being. 

For full automation, stay tuned for the sister sub-repository 'monkeyTracer'.
